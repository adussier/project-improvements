## First Improvement description 
Phaser

The main upgrade for the game, will be the use of Phaser. Phraser is a fast, free and fun open source framework for canvas and WebGL powered browser games. It will allow us to create physics, particles, animations and sprites for our game.

## Second Improvement description
A new Gameplay 

In order to personalise the game, we've decided to add some features. First, We will add hitpoints (HP) to the spaceships in order to make the game a little more challenging. What about collision physics? No more passing through asteroids. Drift between them or pitifully explode. Boring fights with your silly rockets? Then destroy your enemies with lasers, exploding rockets, multishots and whatever you find. More of the strategic type? Then pass through enemies attacks with shields or sneak behind them with invisibility.

## Features

- Play an endless game until you die and be the potato king of space.
- Choose you name before playing (find the secret potatoes spaceships).
- Climb the leaderboard by gaining points.
- Gain points by exploding asteroids, burning enemies or sneakily surviving the bombarding fest.
- Collect temporary bonuses to turn the tides of battle.
